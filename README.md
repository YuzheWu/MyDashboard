A project realized as part of an internship at a moving service company.

This web based dashboard displays breakdowns of sales according to different attributes, e.g. pick-up/drop-off address, date, urgency, order value, etc, to help better understand the state of the business. The interactive part is that by filtering data in one chart, the charts associated with other attributes also changes accordingly. 

The visualization code is located at /public/js/Dashboard.js
